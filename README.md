# Hacker News top stories, over email!
If you're like me and often find yourself spending hours browsing Hacker News, this script might be just what you need. 

Itâ€™s designed to fetch the top stories (limited to a specified number) from Hacker News. After getting each top story, it uses ConvertKit to send an email with the content of the stories. 

ConvertKit is an email service which has a free tier, this is all you'd need to make this script work.

Here is an example of the email you'd expect to recieve:

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python

A pure Python script that uses the official Hacker News API to fetch the top stories, and then uses ConvertKit, a free email service, to send these stories in a neatly formatted email. 

The project was designed with simplicity in mind, using only essential third-party APIs to achieve the functionality.

This runs locally on my machine using a cron job.
